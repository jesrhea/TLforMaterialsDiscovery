# TLforMaterialsDiscovery

This repository contains scripts written for the Master's project __[title]__. 

## COF Gas Adsorption 

This folder contains scripts and data required for COFid generation and generating a representative subset of the original [COF gas adsorption dataset](https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2018.0003/v2). 

## MOF Thermal Conductivity 

This folder contains scripts to extract structural features and train tree-based models on the [MOF thermal conductivity dataset](https://github.com/meiirbek-islamov/thermal-transport-MOFs). There are also structural and MOFid data for fine-tuning MOFormer.
